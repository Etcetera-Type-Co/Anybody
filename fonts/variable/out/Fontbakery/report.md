<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Checking OS/2 usWeightClass.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/usweightclass](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/usweightclass)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Google Fonts expects variable fonts, static ttfs and static otfs to have
differing OS/2 usWeightClass values.
For Variable Fonts, Thin-Black must be 100-900
For static ttfs, Thin-Black can be 100-900 or 250-900
For static otfs, Thin-Black must be 250-900
If static otfs are set lower than 250, text may appear blurry in legacy Windows
applications.
Glyphsapp users can change the usWeightClass value of an instance by adding a
&#x27;weightClass&#x27; customParameter.</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** OS/2 usWeightClass is '100' when it should be '400'. [code: bad-value]

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Check name table: TYPOGRAPHIC_SUBFAMILY_NAME entries.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/typographicsubfamilyname](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/typographicsubfamilyname)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Requirements for the TYPOGRAPHIC_SUBFAMILY_NAME entries in the &#x27;name&#x27; table.</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** TYPOGRAPHIC_SUBFAMILY_NAME entry for Win "UltraCondensed Thin" must be "Regular". Please note, since the font style is RIBBI, this record can be safely deleted. [code: bad-win-name]

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Ensure VFs do not contain slnt or ital axes. </summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/varfont/unsupported_axes](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/varfont/unsupported_axes)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
The &#x27;ital&#x27; and &#x27;slnt&#x27; axes are not supported yet in Google Chrome.
For the time being, we need to ensure that VFs do not contain either of these
axes. Once browser support is better, we can deprecate this check.
For more info regarding browser support, see:
https://arrowtype.github.io/vf-slnt-test/</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** The "slnt" axis is not yet well supported on Google Chrome. [code: unsupported-slnt]

</details>
<details>
<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Validate STAT particle names and values match the fallback names in GFAxisRegistry. </summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/STAT/gf-axisregistry](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/STAT/gf-axisregistry)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Check that particle names and values on STAT table match the fallback names in
each axis entry at the Google Fonts Axis Registry, available at
https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/axisregistry</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** On the font variation axis 'slnt', the name 'Upright' is not among the expected ones (Default) according to the Google Fonts Axis Registry. [code: invalid-name]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Are there caret positions declared for every ligature?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.
If using GlyphsApp or UFOs, ligature carets can be defined as anchors with names
starting with &#x27;caret_&#x27;. These can be compiled with fontmake as of version
v2.4.0.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This font lacks caret position values for ligature glyphs on its GDEF table. [code: lacks-caret-pos]

</details>
<details>
<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Is there kerning info for non-ligated sequences?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/kerning_for_non_ligated_sequences](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/kerning_for_non_ligated_sequences)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg
https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/issues/14).</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** GPOS table lacks kerning info for the following non-ligated sequences:
	- f + f
	- f + i
	- i + f
	- f + l
	- l + f
	- i + l

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Combined length of family and style must not exceed 27 characters.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/family_and_style_max_length](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/family_and_style_max_length)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
According to a GlyphsApp tutorial [1], in order to make sure all versions of
Windows recognize it as a valid font file, we must make sure that the
concatenated length of the familyname (NameID.FONT_FAMILY_NAME) and style
(NameID.FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME) strings in the name table do not exceed 20
characters.
After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we
decided that allowing up to 27 chars would still be on the safe side, though.
[1] https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/multiple-masters-part-3-setting-up-instances
[2] https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/issues/2179</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The combined length of family and style exceeds 27 chars in the following 'WINDOWS' entries:
 FONT_FAMILY_NAME = 'Anybody UltraCondensed Thin' / SUBFAMILY_NAME = 'Regular'

Please take a look at the conversation at https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/issues/2179 in order to understand the reasoning behind these name table records max-length criteria. [code: too-long]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Ensure Stylistic Sets have description.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/stylisticset_description](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/stylisticset_description)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Stylistic sets should provide description text. Programs such as InDesign,
TextEdit and Inkscape use that info to display to the users so that they know
what a given stylistic set offers.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The stylistic set ss01 lacks a description string on the 'name' table. [code: missing-description]

</details>
<details>
<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Ensure fonts have ScriptLangTags declared on the 'meta' table.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This font file does not have a 'meta' table. [code: lacks-meta-table]

<details>
<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Does the font have a DSIG table?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/dsig](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/dsig.html#com.google.fonts/check/dsig)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Microsoft Office 2013 and below products expect fonts to have a digital
signature declared in a DSIG table in order to implement OpenType features. The
EOL date for Microsoft Office 2013 products is 4/11/2023. This issue does not
impact Microsoft Office 2016 and above products.
As we approach the EOL date, it is now considered better to completely remove
the table.
But if you still want your font to support OpenType features on Office 2013,
then you may find it handy to add a fake signature on a dummy DSIG table by
running one of the helper scripts provided at
https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools
Reference: https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/issues/1845</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This font has a digital signature (DSIG table) which is only required - even if only a dummy placeholder - on old programs like MS Office 2013 in order to work properly.
The current recommendation is to completely remove the DSIG table. [code: found-DSIG]
